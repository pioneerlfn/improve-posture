## Web Application vs Web Service

In other words, a program needs to fulfill only two criteria to be considered a web app:
- The program must return HTML to a calling client that renders HTML and dis- plays to a user.
- The data must be transported to the client through HTTP.

As an extension of this definition, if a program doesnâ€™t render HTML to a user but instead returns data in any other format to another program, it is a **web service** (that is, it provides a service to other programs).
